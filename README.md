Hi I'm Mike Vardy! 👋 

I am a Senior Full Stack Web Dev with a decade of helping brands tell their story online. Currently I work full time for [REDspace](redspace.com) but if you have an interesting project you can read my [sales pictch](https://i-heart-php.github.io/me/) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mvardy/).

# Did you know…?

- 🇨🇦  ... I am Canadian & live just couple hours east of Toronto in [Bellville, Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belleville,_Ontario).
- 👪🏽  ... My wife Amanda and I have 2 teenagers, Logan & Kaity
- 🤔  ... Problem solving is addictive and chase the feeling when my code works as intended
- 🍺  ... I love craft beer, it's hard to pick a favourite but [FORGOTTEN LAKE BLUEBERRY ALE](https://www.lowbrewco.com/forgotten-lake/) comes pretty close
